# Homework 2

## Run

`python3 hw2_lm.py berp-training.txt hw2-test.txt hw2-my-test.txt`

## Notes

Running your code with the given command (see below) should produce the following files:

hw2-unigram-out.txt (containing probabilities for the provided test set using a unigram model, one probability per line, in the order corresponding to the test file)

hw2-bigram-out.txt (containing probabilities for the provided test set using a bigram model, one probability per line, in the order corresponding to the test file)

hw2-unigram-generated.txt (the 100 sentences that you generated from your unigram model, one per line)

hw2-bigram-generated.txt (the 100 sentences that you generated from your bigram model, one per line)

hw2-unigram-histogram.pdf

hw2-bigram-histogram.pdf

It's important that the test output files are named correctly and for the format to be correct in order for the grading scripts to work correctly.
